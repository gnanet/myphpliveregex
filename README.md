# MyPHPLiveRegex
### clone of [phpliveregex](https://www.phpliveregex.com/) online version

 - Formatting the output of the various regex functions is done using [REF a nicer alternative to PHP's print_r](https://github.com/digitalnature/php-ref)
 - The AJAX processing of the regexes is based on the [code](https://github.com/PmaControl/PmaControl/blob/master/application/controller/PhpLiveRegex.controller.php) found in [PmaControl](https://github.com/PmaControl/PmaControl) but it was rewritten to support all preg_ functions of the original PhpLiveRegex page
 - The page itself is partly based on the [html view](https://github.com/PmaControl/PmaControl/blob/master/application/view/PhpLiveRegex/index.view.php) and the [JS source](https://github.com/PmaControl/PmaControl/blob/master/application/webroot/js/PhpLiveRegex/index.js).
 - The referred 3rd party Javascript/CSS are based on the html source from the original [phpliveregex](https://www.phpliveregex.com/) site
